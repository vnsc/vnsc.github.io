<p>From this view we can see a very busy scene is
playing out at Emu Creek.</p>

<p>The local pass is waiting a road to clear as the
heavy laden cement train from Geelong is
needed for more construction work along the
line. It is being hauled by a T and 2 Y class locos
as most of the mainline power is off on other
duties so a lash up was needed to haul the train.</p>

<p>All 3 locos have been scratch built over the years.</p>
