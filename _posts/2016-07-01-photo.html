<img src="/images/photo-of-the-month/2016-07.jpg">

<p>The inspiration for this scene came from a fallen tree I had noticed in a paddock beside the Princes Highway in Gippsland. It reminded me of many I had seen whilst travelling throughout Victoria.</p>

<p>The trunk and branches were made from good old Sedum, which forms the basis for the gum trees on my layout. The branches on one side were cut off so the trunk would lie flat on the ground. The root ball is built up from Selleys All-Fix.</p>
