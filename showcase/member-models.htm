<p>Not every item made by members is a loco or wagon. Ian F added a host of typical country items to the farmers truck.&nbsp; This is one of the featured cameo scenes on the award winning N scale layout <a href="http://www.australianmodelrailways.com/dbsearch/amrm279.html"> Wallan</a> owned within the collective.</p>

<p>A late running multi-unit lash up of John Miller's DL, EL and AN cross the Boundry road crossing and take refuge in the standard gauge loop as Westrail's L257 waits impatiently for the chance to head north. The beauty about having your own railway is that you can stage these sorts of crossed when friends drop in from afar. All locos are heavy modified brass kits by N-Scale-Australia that John M. has put together.</p>
